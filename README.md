# BinarySerializer.Ubisoft.GbaEngine
BinarySerializer.Ubisoft.GbaEngine is an extension library to [BinarySerializer](https://github.com/BinarySerializer/BinarySerializer) for Ubisoft's GbaEngine. Currently it's only targeting Rayman 3, but it is planned to receive support for all of the games which [Ray1Map](https://github.com/BinarySerializer/Ray1Map) supports, which includes the three available engine branches (Montreal, Milan and Shanghai).
